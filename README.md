datadjables
===========

jQuery Datatables for Django (ajaxy, no pagination necessary, nice filter columns)
Filtering by columns is made possible by the great ColumnFilter plugin
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-column-filter/wiki/ColumnFilter

The whole code should be up here in about a week from now. (2014-10-16)

I just wanted to reserve the name "datadjables", since there are already so many Django-Datatable plugins
online which all did not really do what I needed.

Stay tuned, hopefully you'll like this.

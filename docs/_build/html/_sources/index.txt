DataDjables documentation
===============================

DataDjables connects to the jQuery plug-in DataTables (http://datatables.net/) for server-side processing.

Based on a queryset you define columns which may or may not be sortable and filterable,
and display the results filling a configurable amount of a browsers viewport.
The result is a very responsive window to your database.

DataDjables have almost 100% test coverage and tries to blend into the way Django itself is built.
